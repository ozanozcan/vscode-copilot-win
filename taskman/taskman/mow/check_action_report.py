"""Fail if a mow stem's action report is missing, skeletal, or unlinked.

The action report is the run's primary durable output — the thing anyone reads a
month later to find out what shipped and what was decided — and until this gate
existed nothing read it back. /mow go §4 calls it "required — do not skip" and
lists its sections; a run could flip to `shipped` with no report at all, or with
five headings and no bodies, and nothing would notice.

Section names and frontmatter fields here are taken from the shape already in the
tree (docs/plans/harness-boundary/action-report.md), not invented: this gate has
to pass the best existing report or it is measuring the wrong thing.

An empty section is a failure, but `*None — <reason>*` satisfies it, exactly as the
plan.md register sections work — "None, because …" is a claim someone made, an
omitted section is indistinguishable from one nobody considered.

A diffstat with nothing on its line saying where it came from is a failure. L58
(never hand-write a derived value) was routed to prose on 2026-09-14 and recurred
three days later as a `+171/−?` typed into a report; the prose rule caught it only
on a re-read. The shape has a source that can print it, so the gate asks for the
source on the same line — `git diff --numstat` / `--shortstat`, or the `a..b`
range it was run over. Reports in the tree had already carried two wrong ones
(workflow-harden-talks row 10, work-pc-readiness-followups row 6) before this.

Reports dated on or after RUN_REPORT_CUTOFF are also read as a reader's run report:
`## Why we did it` and `## Vision vs shipped` (bodies or a None marker), and the
run-record block `python -m taskman.mow.run_report <stem> --write` generates. Older
reports are checked exactly as before.

Usage:
  python -m taskman.mow.check_action_report docs/plans/<stem>

Exit 0 = report is complete. Exit 1 = refuse the `shipped` flip. Exit 2 = usage.
