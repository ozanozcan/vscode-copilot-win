"""Event envelope schema: what replay is willing to recognise.

Every event is one JSON line `{"v": 1, "type": "<entity>.<verb>", "id": N,
"ts": "<utc iso>", ...payload}`. Replay is fail-closed on purpose (plan d-p1):
board and code travel in the same git tree, so an old reader meeting a newer
board must stop loudly — an unknown entity, unknown verb, missing `v`, or
`v` above SUPPORTED_VERSION is a refusal, never a silent skip.

The constant tuples below are COPIED verbatim from models.py, not imported:
models.py dies with the database in wave 2, and this package imports nothing
outside the standard library by contract.
