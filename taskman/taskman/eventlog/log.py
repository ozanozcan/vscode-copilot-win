"""Append-only event log: one JSON object per line in board/events.jsonl.

One lock file, board.lock, serializes every mutation — the log append *and*
the id counters — so there is no lock ordering to get wrong. O_APPEND is not
atomic on Windows, which is exactly why appends go through the lock too.

Ids come from a counter file, never from the log's length: a counter only
grows, so an id can never be reissued even if an add event was lost to a
crash — the same gap semantics as the Postgres sequence this replaces.
Counters are per entity (plan d-p4): one JSON file `next_ids`, keyed by
entity name, written whole via tmp + os.replace.
