"""O_EXCL lockfile — the one concurrency primitive of the eventlog store.

Never fcntl: flock is POSIX-only and does not exist on Windows CPython (Git
Bash included). `os.open(..., O_CREAT | O_EXCL)` is atomic on both families,
so existence of the lock file *is* the lock.

Crashed holders leave the file behind, so a lock is judged stale purely by
age (mtime): liveness probing via `os.kill(pid, 0)` is off the table because
on Windows that call *terminates* the process. Hold times here are one JSON
line's worth of I/O, so `STALE_AFTER` has orders-of-magnitude headroom, and
it is kept below the acquire timeout so a crashed holder is recovered from
within a single default `exclusive()` call rather than wedging the board.

The holder keeps the fd open for the whole hold. POSIX ignores that, but on
Windows it makes a live holder's lock unbreakable (rename fails while a
handle is open), which turns the stale-break race into a POSIX-only concern.

Windows also reports contention two ways, not one: a lock that still exists
raises FileExistsError, but a lock the last holder just unlinked keeps its
name until the handle closes, and opening a delete-pending name raises
PermissionError. Both mean "held, try again"; treating only the first as
contention is what made concurrent creates crash on CI.
